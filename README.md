# VPN Relay for HomeBox

Self-hosting your emails, calendars, contacts, etc. is nice, but requires one thing that is sometimes difficult to
obtain: a static - or fixed - IP address.

The purpose of this project is to provide at least one IP address to your
[HomeBox](https://github.com/progmaticltd/homebox), using OpenVPN and various cloud providers. Your files are still
stored at home, on your hardware. The VPN access point only relays the internet traffic to your box, especially the
remote connections. Stay tuned.
